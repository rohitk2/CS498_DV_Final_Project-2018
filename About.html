<h1>ABOUT THIS VISUALIZATION</h1>
<p>
This visualization follows a interactive slideshow format. Apart from the ranking slide and the first overview slide, they each follow the same template.
The template includes a bar graph with a paragraph description above. You can hover over the bars to see the parameters better.
The parameters are points per game, points given up per game, and colleges.
The triggers are which parameters I will show.
There will be a next button that will take you to the next slide and a last button that will take you to the last slide at the top of the page.
The interactive events include the next/last button and the hovering.
